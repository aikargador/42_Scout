# 42_Scout

Students within the 42 cursus can sometimes struggle to find colleagues who would support them in certain endeavors (specifically with projects), and efforts to search for colleauges within the wanted criteria of project progression and expertise may prove difficult.

Therefore we plan to create an interactive web application that would categorize a student's search to help in specifying who to search, whether it may be for projects, on-campus events or jobs and collaborations. 

Potential inclusion may involve: 
  -Booking a schedule with them, utilizing their open slots stated within the intra website, helping people connect easier with minimal effort of scanning social media or intra's search engine.
  -Providing potential evaluation points to colleagues utilizing the feature.

Teammates include:
   -Abdul aziz Mohamed Aikram
   -Ammar Albreiki
